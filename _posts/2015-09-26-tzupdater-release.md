The application appeared because of the current difficult situation with the update of time zones in Android. The International Time Zone Database is updated every month, but there are no regular means of updating this database on devices. Keep track of time zone updates and release timely firmware updates, in theory, should device manufacturers, but in fact it is not. As a result, Timezone Updater was developed, which downloads and updates to the latest version of the time zone data on the Android device. The [time zone database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) and [ICU data](http://site.icu-project.org) are updated. This application is designed to solve all the known problems associated with time zones in Android.
