For a long time, I wanted to make a full-fledged implementation of the front-end UX library like Vue, React, or Solid. The previous attempt was implemented as a library [LibUX](/2021/12/02/libux/). This library was based on JS classes and implements component rendering functionality based on an EJS-like template syntax. Also, there is implemented support for working with states, routing, and localization.

This year I was able to take the time to design and develop a more modern approach. So the [NEUX](https://github.com/meefik/neux) library appeared. The library includes a set of functions for creating such entities as states, views, localization, routing, synchronization with storage, remote procedure call. The library is available for use both with and without builders.

[NEUX](https://github.com/meefik/neux) or Native Extended User eXperience (its short name is `{\}`) is a lightweight frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces using declarative element definitions and reactive signals to modify them. It leverages native JavaScript and browser APIs to minimize boilerplate, making it ideal for creating single page applications (SPA) and custom web components.

Here are the main concepts behind NEUX:

- No JSX, no compiler, just in real-time.
- Framework-agnostic, use any part of the library independently.
- Declarative element definitions using plain objects powered by reactive state management.
- Intuitive two-way reactivity with direct DOM changes without virtual DOM.
- Built-in localization support for dynamic language adaptation.
- Easy integration with CSS modules, Tailwind CSS, and other styling solutions.
- Minimal bundle size (~4kb gzipped) for fast loading.
- Open source and available under the MIT license.

Additional information is available on [the project page](/neux).
