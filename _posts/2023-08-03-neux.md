For a long time, I wanted to make a full-fledged implementation of the front-end UX library like Vue, React, or Solid. The previous attempt was implemented as a library [LibUX](/2021/12/02/libux/). This library was based on JS classes and implements component rendering functionality based on an EJS-like template syntax. Also, there is implemented support for working with states, routing, and localization.

This year I was able to take the time to design and develop a more modern approach. So the [NEUX](https://github.com/meefik/neux) library appeared. The library includes a set of functions for creating such entities as states, views, localization, routing, synchronization with storage, remote procedure call. The library is available for use both with and without builders.

[NEUX](https://github.com/meefik/neux) is a nifty ecosystem for user experience development. Its short name is `{\}`. The JavaScript frontend library has features and tools are suitable for building single-page applications (SPA).

Here are the main concepts behind NEUX:

- Minimum interaction with the library during development, more native JS code.
- Instead of HTML templates and JSX, defining views as nested JS objects with a set of attributes that are completely equivalent to the attributes of native HTML elements.
- Support for modern two-way reactivity.
- Availability of standard components to implement the basic SPA functionality:
  - routing,
  - localization,
  - synchronization of states with persistent storage,
  - calling remote procedures on the backend.
- Small library size ~ 5kb (gzipped).

Additional information is available on [the project page](/neux).

I prepared an example [To-Do app](https://github.com/meefik/neux-todo-app) to demonstrate how the library works.

This example uses the stack: [NEUX](https://github.com/meefik/neux) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
