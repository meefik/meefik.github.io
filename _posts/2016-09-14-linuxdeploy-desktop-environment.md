Linux Deploy supports automatic installation and configuration of some of the most common desktop environments. Version [LD 2.0](https://github.com/meefik/linuxdeploy/releases) retains support for XTerm (full-screen terminal), LXDE, Xfce, and MATE environments. These environments are in almost all supported LD distributions, they are not very demanding on resources and can work without graphical acceleration. However, you can start other desktop environments manually. To do this, in the LD settings, select the "Other" desktop environment and execute the "Configure" command. After that, you need to connect to the container, install the packages of the desired environment of the desktop, and under the user (by default - android) edit the file `~/.xsession`, prescribing the command to start the working environment.
